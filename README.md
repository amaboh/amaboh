## Other Stuff about me
👩‍💻 I'm currently working on working at mySKinci a skincare solution to provide personalized recommendations skincare routines using computer vision, GNN, RL and Generative AI.

🧠 I'm curious about recommendation systems for different use cases in my free time I try to read papers and develop recommendation systems. 

🤝 I'm looking to collaborate on projects in process automation, interested in finance and healthcare data but open-minded.

🎤 I enjoy talking to data practitoners on the Data Queries podcast. Check it @Data Queries on Spotify, Apple, and Google Podcast.

🔄 I'm always at a PyData London meetup where I'm a volunteer, and going for tech meetups in any city I live is a monthly duty. 

If was to at anypoint to go into research like a Phd program, I'd like to research into Causal AI for image generation in healthcare. 

I love watching animes when I want to wind down. 

⚡️ Fun fact. Delay gravitation was the fun part of debugging, chatGPT kind of took the fun out. I still prefer StackOverflow though.
